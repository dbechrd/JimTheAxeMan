Some time ago there was a young lumberjack names Jim. He lived
a simple life in the Canadian wilderness. That is, until a
famous military scientist, Logan, and his colleagues from Nevada
decided to develop a potion that would turn nature into the
ultimate weapon.

On a cold day in September the scientists had just perfected
the prototype for their potion they called PT3control. It was
rainy and dark when someone within the company stole the
formula and the prototype and fled to Canada. Her quest, World
Domination, began.

Jim is hiking in the moutains looking for good places to work
when he stumbles upon this mad woman. Unfortunately for Jim
she had just used the PT3control and now he is forced to fight
for his life. He loses and is left for dead. Jim miraculously
survives and is now on a quest to stop this mad woman called
Edna.
