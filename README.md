CS Final Project (high school)

## About

Jime The Axe Man was my final project for Mr. Hurley's Computer Science my junior year of high school.

I was the sole programmer on a team of four people. The other three people were artists. One of them made the character sprites. One of them made the environment art (all in the last week of the semester while high on vicodin after getting his wisdom teeth out. Yes, I'm talking about you, Jake <3). The third one played Minesweeper the whole semester and didn't do any work (for what it's worth, he did become extremely good at Minesweeper).

It was written in Visual Basic .NET using WinForms. I used Label controls in the WinForms design view as a level editor. You would put the file path to the sprite you wanted to place at that position in the label's text property, and the label was replaced with a PictureBox control on form initialization. I still haven't decided whether my teenage self was a moron or a savant.

## Controls

    Left/Right  Move
    Up          Jump
    A           Attack enemies w/ axe        
    Spacebar    Interact (open chests and use med kits)
    F11         Open cheat console (look at source to find cheat codes)
    F12         Pause the game

NOTE: The executable in the Source directory works better than the one in the Release directory.
